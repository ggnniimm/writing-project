# Executive Summary: Procurement Act Section 102
**Subject: Management of Contract Delays, Fine Waivers, and Time Extensions**

## Overview
Section 102 of the Public Procurement Act B.E. 2560 provides the legal framework for granting relief to contractors unable to meet delivery deadlines due to external factors or state fault. This mechanism allows for time extensions or fine waivers/reductions to ensure fairness and project continuity.

## Key Decision Points for Management

### 1. Eligibility for Relief
Management has the discretion to approve relief ONLY under specific conditions:
*   **State Fault:** Delays caused by the agency (e.g., late site handover, design errors).
    *   *Risk:* Mandatory approval required. Failure to grant relief may lead to Administrative Court disputes and liability for undue enrichment.
*   **Force Majeure:** Events beyond control (e.g., floods, pandemics).
*   **Non-Liability Events:** Changes in law or external regulations.

### 2. Critical Timeline Compliance (The 15-Day Rule)
*   **Requirement:** Contractor MUST notify the agency within **15 days** of the end of the event causing delay.
*   **Management Action:**
    *   If notified within 15 days -> Proceed to evaluate merit.
    *   If notified AFTER 15 days -> **Reject immediately** (Legal Precedent: SAC 1766/2559).
        *   *Exception:* Unless the cause was the Agency's own fault (Imputed Knowledge).

### 3. Terminology & Legal Effect
The choice of instrument depends on the timing of approval relative to the contract expiry:
*   **"Time Extension":** Approved **BEFORE** contract expiry.
*   **"Fine Waiver/Reduction":** Approved **AFTER** contract expiry.

## Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Documentation:** Ensure all "State Fault" delays are documented via official memo to prevent future disputes.
2.  **Proactive Extension:** If a delay is clearly the Agency's fault, consider initiating the extension process proactively to maintain project momentum.
3.  **Strict Enforcement:** Adhere strictly to the 15-day notification rule for Force Majeure claims to protect the Agency's legal standing.
